The Elting Lab strives for an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science. We are interested in recruiting trainees with backgrounds in physics, biology, chemistry, and/or engineering. 

**We wholeheartedly believe that the more diverse our lab members are - both scientifically and in terms of life experiences - the more we will learn more from each other, and the better our science. Therefore, we welcome lab members regardless of race, religion, gender identification, sexual orientation, age, or disability status.**

We are actively recruiting new members. If you're interested in joining, please see instructions below.
